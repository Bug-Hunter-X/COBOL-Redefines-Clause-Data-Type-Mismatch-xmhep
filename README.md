This repository demonstrates an uncommon COBOL bug related to the REDEFINES clause and data type mismatches. The bug occurs when alphanumeric data is moved to a field that is then redefined as numeric, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or program termination.  The solution demonstrates how to ensure data type compatibility to avoid the issue.
